"""
Track 1 equivalence scoring (the organiser's half of the common scorer.

Subtrack 1 - global alignment: set-based Precision/Recall/F1 over the complete 
many:many reference (no null-reference exclusion).

Subtrack 2 — local ranking: MRR + Hits@k, one ranking query per reference mapping. 
The metric core is pure + space-agnostic; the loaders read OAEI RDF / DeepOnto TSV 
(rdflib, behind the `[rdf]` extra). The official reasoner-based coherence (DeepOnto/ELK) 
is separate + still deferred.

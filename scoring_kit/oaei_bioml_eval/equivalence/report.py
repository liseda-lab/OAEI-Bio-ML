oaei_bioml_eval.equivalence.report: file -> metric-dict entry points.

`score_global_files` reads a global alignment submission + the complete reference
and returns set P/R/F1; `score_local_files` reads a local ranking submission + the
per-query gold and returns MRR/Hits@k. Both optionally write the metric dict as
JSON. Caller-supplied files must already share one id space (the organiser maps
IRIs/CURIEs before scoring).

    Subtrack 1: BOTH global P/R/F1 families against the reference — the standard set
    P/R/F1 over the complete reference, AND the LargeBio `?`-flagged `*_coherent` family
    that ignores the reference's incoherence-causing (`?`) mappings. The `?` subset is
    auto-detected inline in an RDF reference; a TSV reference carries no `?` so the two
    families coincide. Distinct keys — the families never overwrite each other.

    Scoring is relation-agnostic (existence only): the submission is read with
    load_global_submission (any asserted relation counts) and an Option-Two reference's
    subsumption cells are positives, so a predicted `=` matching a reference `<`/`>` (or the
    reverse) is credited — only the correspondence's existence is scored, never its relation.

    `deprecated` (optional): an iterable of owl:deprecated / obsolete IRIs, OUT-OF-TASK. When
    given, every correspondence touching one is dropped from the prediction AND the reference
    (and its `?` set) before scoring — the same out-of-task treatment the organiser applies (only
    the lite matchers predict any, so this changes their precision). Default None = no filtering.
